### Q1 2025 Objectives

This quarter, we will bring new feature improvements to make Experiments more advanced. We'll also focus on improving quality across different areas - data, documentation, and codebase - to help us move faster and deliver a better product.

#### Objective 1: New features
- [Timeseries chart for deltas and credible intervals](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/26931) @jurajmajerik 
- [Winsorization](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/26060) to exclude extreme values from analyses. @andehen 
- [New data collection calculator](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/26933) @andehen 
- [Filtering for experiment results](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/26934) @danielbachhuber 

#### Objective 2: Data & statistics
- Complete the [migration to updated statistical methods](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/26713).
- Document each statistical method in detail.
- Write a practical "manual" chapter for every metric type.
- Address neglected cases, such as "average count per user."
- Improve diagnostics to provide more detailed information, like flagging missing exposure data. @andehen 

#### Objective 3: Data Warehouse integration @danielbachhuber 
- Ensure a great experience for our pilot users.
- Add support for funnel experiments.
- Graduate the integration out of beta.

#### Objective 4: UX & UI
- Polish the reusable metrics UI. @jurajmajerik 
- Add new summary banners to support multiple metrics.
- Improve product analytics insights when transitioning from experiments.
- [Polish no-code experiments UI](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/26936)
- Add [in-product tooltips](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/26937).

#### Objective 5: Codebase quality
- Improve test coverage for query runners and add missing legacy code test cases.
- Add E2E for the basic flows once the multi-metrics UI stabilizes.
- Avoid global updates from modals that require page reloads on Cancel.
- Refactor experiment logic to remove dependencies on logics, improve reusability, and delete dead code.
- Set up monitoring for query timeouts.
- Audit Sentry to ensure weâ€™re tracking the most relevant issues.
