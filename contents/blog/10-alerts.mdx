# 10 ways to use alerts

PostHog's new alert features allow you to receive notifications based on thresholds. Here is how to get started and some examples of how they can be useful.

## How to create an alert

- Select an insight.
- Create an alert.
- Set a threshold.

Threshold alerts, percentage change, and trends with breakdowns.

## Practical examples

### Traffic spike alert

High website traffic alert (e.g. notify if this page gets more than x views in a day)

### Conversion rate

> When the conversion rate drops below a certain threshold

### Error alerts

- If errors today > X
- 404s surpass a threshold
- rage clicks and dead clicks

### Monitoring Deploys

> "This would be useful as a simple canary to catch misconfigured deployments"

### Billing Check

Test the absence of something happening: If no transactional billing emails are sent, alert the growth team.

### Alert on breakdown in referral sources

Alert on major changes in breakdowns. "For example, I have a graph showing traffic to my site by day broken down by referrer - if there's a major change in who's referring traffic (a bunch of new traffic from a new source, or a previous major source of traffic disappearing) I'd love to be able to get alerts about that, even if the overall traffic total doesn't shift.

## Upcoming features

Currently alerts are available for Trends. But they're also in the works for funnels, which will make conversion alerts better.

## Suggestions?

Any other features you'd like to see? Or interesting use cases to share?

## Notes

- Come up with a much better title
- Use the examples to ensure all the useful features are shared.
- For example, notifying the growth team is a good example to show how you can notify multiple people for a single alert.
- What examples do other services show for their alert features?
