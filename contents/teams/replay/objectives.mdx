# 🚀 Goal 1: Get Alex rocketing

it's great to have Alex on the team... let's make it a success

# 👩‍🔬 Goal 2: Churn and retention exploration

We've had a lot of technology focus, let's have some product focus

* stronger understanding and tracking of churn and retention
* user interviews to narrow focus
* experiments and improvements from them

# 🎤 Goal 3: Watch less and get more value

We've got good evidence that some customers need help finding which recordings to watch. We want to help people more quickly find the right recordings to watch.

* HogBot 
    * part 1 was very simple but people liked it... let's grow HogBot
    * bring people back into the product from email or slack by highlighting what they want to watch
* Magic playlists
    * playlists are not used much but people who use them like them and have diverse reasons
    * we can autogenerate useful playlists and prompt you when they have new recordings
